ASA filament flow calibration:

changed extrusion multiplier under filament setting back to 1; befor was 0.924

Filament Temperature Calibration: hard to tell, does not look good - retry, for now optimal tem=245C

Retraction calibration
under printer settings changed retraction length to 0.7mm after retraction calibration with 245C
before retraction length was set to 0.5mm
